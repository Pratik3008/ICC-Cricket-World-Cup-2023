Certainly! Let's break down the Python script step by step:

1.Data Loading:

The script starts by importing necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn modules.
Two datasets, world_cup and results, are loaded using Pandas from CSV files.

2.Data Cleaning:

The 'Match Date' column in the 'results' dataset is converted to datetime format.
The script extracts the last two digits of the year from the 'Match Date' column and filters data for the year 2023.
Teams participating in the World Cup 2023 are specified in the 'worldcup_teams' list.

3.Feature Engineering:

The script creates a new DataFrame, df_teams_2023, by selecting rows where teams from the 'worldcup_teams' list are involved.
A new column, 'winning_team', is created and initialized to 0.
'winning_team' is set to 1 if 'Team 1' wins and 2 if 'Team 2' wins.

4.One-Hot Encoding:

The script uses one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
Dummy variables are created for the teams participating in the matches.

5.Model Training:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers are trained using scikit-learn.
The accuracy of each model on the training and test sets is printed.

5.ICC Rankings and Fixtures:

ICC rankings and fixtures for the World Cup are loaded from CSV files.
Initial positions of teams in fixtures are inserted based on their ICC rankings.

7.Match Prediction:

A set of matches for the semi-finals and finals are defined.
A function, clean_and_predict, is created to clean the data and make predictions using the trained Random Forest classifier.
The function prints the predicted winners for each match.

8.Example Usage:

The script provides an example of using the clean_and_predict function for predicting semi-finals and finals in the World Cup.

In summary, the script loads and preprocesses World Cup data, trains machine learning models, incorporates ICC rankings, defines fixtures,
and predicts match outcomes using a Random Forest classifier. The predictions are based on team rankings, and the script demonstrates 
how to use the trained model to forecast the winners of specific matches.
